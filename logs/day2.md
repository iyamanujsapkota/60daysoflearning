### Software Development Life Cycle ( SDLC )

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond.

------

### SDLC Phases

- Plan
- Design
- Implement
- Test
- Deploy
- Maintain

----

### SDLC Models

- Waterfall
- Iterative
- V-model
- Agile 
- Spiral
- DevOps 

----

### QA Process in Different Models

- Waterfall: QA activities are phase-specific, with dedicated testing after development is complete.

- V-model: QA planning and activities run in parallel with each development phase, ensuring verification and validation at each step.

- Agile: QA is continuous and integrated throughout iterative development cycles, with frequent testing and feedback loops.

- Spiral Model: QA focuses on risk assessment and mitigation, with testing conducted during each iterative spiral.

- DevOps Model: QA is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, emphasizing continuous testing, automation, and monitoring.

- Incremental and Iterative Models: QA tests each increment or iteration separately, ensuring integration and continuous feedback for improvement.
