### What is QA? 

Quality Assurance, refers to a systematic process designed to determine whether a product or service meets specified requirements. QA involves activities and measures taken to ensure the quality of products or services in a consistent manner. 

### Role of a QA engineer

A QA Engineer ensures software quality through comprehensive testing processes. They analyze requirements, develop test plans, create and execute test cases, and manage defects. By conducting both manual and automated tests, QA Engineers identify issues and work closely with developers to resolve them. They perform performance and security testing, integrate tests with CI/CD pipelines, and provide detailed reports on quality metrics. Through continuous collaboration with cross-functional teams and staying updated with industry best practices, QA Engineers ensure that the final product meets user expectations and functions reliably.

### Difference between QA and QC

- QA (Quality Assurance) is about defining and refining processes to prevent defects. It is process-oriented, focusing on the prevention of quality issues.

 - QC (Quality Control) is about identifying defects in the final product. It is product-oriented, focusing on the detection of quality issues.


### Types of Testing ( Manual vs Automated)

- Manual Testing : Manual Testing is a process in which a human tester manually executes test cases without the use of automation tools. The tester plays the role of an end user and verifies if all the features of the application are working correctly by following a set of predefined test cases or by exploring the application. It provides:
    -  A way to simulate the experience of the user
    - Flexibility and adaptability
    - A quick way to identify overall usability


- Automated Testing: Automated Testing is a process in which software tools and scripts automatically execute test cases on the software application. The primary purpose of automated testing is to perform repetitive tests quickly and efficiently. It involves writing test scripts that simulate user interactions and validate the softwareâ€™s functionality, performance, and security. It provides:
    - Repeatable, accurate results
    - Centralized control over testing data
    - The ability to repeat and scale test cases
