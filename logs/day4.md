### Levels of Testing

1. Unit Testing : Unit testing involves verifying the functionality of individual components or modules of a software application in isolation from the rest of the system. Each unit, typically a single function or method, is tested to ensure it behaves as expected, catching bugs early in the development cycle.

2. Integration Testing : Integration testing focuses on the interactions between integrated units or modules. This type of testing aims to identify issues in the interfaces and data flow between modules, ensuring that combined components work together as intended and that integrated functionalities meet requirements.

3. System Testing : System testing is a comprehensive evaluation of the entire, fully integrated software application. This testing phase validates the end-to-end system specifications, assessing both functional and non-functional requirements to ensure the software operates correctly in a complete and integrated environment.

4. Acceptance Testing : Acceptance testing determines whether the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment. It is often performed by end-users or clients to verify that the software system fulfills their needs and criteria, serving as the final validation before the product goes live.
